Steps to setup the Project

1) Install the following from the nuget packet manager
	- StructureMap.WebApi2
	- Structuremap
	- ServiceStack.Redis
	
2) Once you start the project if you have a error message "Could not load file or assembly 'System.Web.Mvc' or one of its dependencies." . It will be the System.Mvc version that is in your Visual Studio. You need to update that in the Web.Config file.

3) I have used to redis to maintain in-memory storage. So you need to run the redis-server.exe and redis-cli.exe in order to run redis and monitor the data inside it.

4) For the Unit Test, You need to install moq and reference the LibApp Project.
